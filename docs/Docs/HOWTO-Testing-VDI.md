## Citrix  - Cloud Service Trails

Trials for individual Citrix Cloud services are delivered through the Citrix Cloud management console. The functionality in a service trial is the same as the purchased service, so they’re suitable for a proof-of-concept (POC) or pilot deployment.

When you’re ready to buy Citrix Cloud services, your trial is converted to a production service. There’s no need to reconfigure anything or create a separate production account.
