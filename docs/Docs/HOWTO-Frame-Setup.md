## Frame on OS 11 (steps to build custom partition)

Over a year ago (December 2020) we jointly developed automated custom partition (CP) builder for Frame.

On [GitHub](https://github.com/IGEL-Community/IGEL-Custom-Partitions/tree/master/CP_Source/Apps/Frame) we have a build script to automate the creation of custom partition that can be used with your current IGEL OS version. The build process takes less than a minute to run.

## Frame on IGEL (demo)

For this demo, I'm using my Dynabook laptop in Austin, Texas to connect to Frame Session in Germany. I'm using Zoom running native on the laptop to record this demo.

**NOTE:** The YouTube video may appear a little choppy from side effect of how this session was recorded but to the user on the laptop it is not choppy.
