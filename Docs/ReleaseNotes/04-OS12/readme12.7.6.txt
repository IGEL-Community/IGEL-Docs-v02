Release Notes of installable IGEL OS 12 base system
================================================================================

# Changes since: 12.7.5

## New Features
- Added TPM-based device encryption support for HP t740 and t755. (requires 12.7.6 and above; downgrades below 12.7.6 are not supported)
- **Remote Management**
	- Added additional remote management status information to the device information bundle for support.

## Security Fixes
- Fixed boot code to prevent unauthenticated root access via boot parameters.
- Fixed inetutils security issues CVE-2026-32746, CVE-2026-28372, CVE-2026-24061 and CVE-2023-40303.

## Resolved Issues
- Fixed broken theme icons.
- Fixed XKB level type for ca(multix) to match expected layout behavior.
- Fixed VM startup via the IGEL Managed Hypervisor (IMH) app.
- Fixed timezone selection in Time & Date tray.
- **Network**
	- Fixed an issue where proxy authentication errors were displayed too early or before any credentials were entered on the login screen.
	- Fixed issue with registry settings for rtw89-driver not being applied.
- **Hardware**
	- Fixed the default disabled configuration of touch input on ELO touchscreen devices. If required, it can be enabled in Setup under User Interface > Input > Touchscreen.
	- Updated firmware for the amdgpu driver for potential stability improvements on Lenovo T14 Gen 6 AMD devices.
	- Fixed that Pepperl+Fuchs BTC22 and BTC24 devices were shown as not supported.
- **Remote Management**
	- Fixed reconnecting mechanism when disconnect happens during initial data exchange between device and the UMS.
	- Fixed evaluation of DHCP options for auto-registering of the IGEL OS in the UMS if DHCP option 43 is used for encapsulation IGEL specific options.

## Known Issues
- In very rare cases all apps are lost after an update. Should this be the case, an error message is shown "Opening system App Journal failed." - if the device is manged, the apps will be reinstalled after a reboot.
- Increased writeable cache partition size (by default). First boot with 12.4.x and newer may take more time (once) when updating from a 12.2.x or older base system app.
- Automatic proxy configuration: PAC file URL does not support https scheme.
- When TPM PCR+PIN device encryption is enabled, an additional PIN entry is required the first time a new base system release is booted.
- **App Management**
	- Downgrades to versions prior to 12.7.0 are possible - despite the implemented downgrade limit - via the Local App Portal or using igelpkgctl through local terminal. In UMS-managed environments, disabling the Local App Portal is recommended to ensure version control. If the older shim bootloader signature (in 12.6.1 PR1 or earlier) is revoked and Secure Boot is enabled, the device may become unbootable. Verify boot compatibility before downgrading.
- **Chromium**
	- Downgrading base system to earlier versions may result in reset of the Chromium profile partition.
- **Network**
	- In some cases, network is not working in combination of Lenovo K14 Gen1 (AMD) and Lenovo Universal Dock. There is a kernel bugreport open but no proper fix so far.
	- Device configured as Wake on LAN proxy can be shut down by the user or admin
	- Proxy passthrough authentication together with AD auto logon does work despite of shown error message during logon.
- **WiFi**
	- WiFi chipset BE200 does not work reliable in WiFi 7 networks.
- **HID**
	- Some touchpads are recognized as touchpad and mouse. This results in showing possible user settings for both variants.
- **Setup Assistant**
	- Timezone auto-detection is currently not functional (due to discontinued location service). The timezone must be set manually (as interims / alternative solution).
- **Audio**
	- Headset mic via jack is not working on LG 27CN650 and LG 34CN650.
	- Audio devices may not be available in audio tray app. Workaround: Enable Pulseaudio backend by registry key:
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `Audiobackend`  |  `multimedia.audiobackend`  |  [pipewire][pulseaudio]  |  *pipewire*  |
	- The Audio Tray App may incorrectly display a plugged-in Audio-Jack-Headset as Built-in Audio / HDMI / DiplayPort instead of the correct headset name. Audio and Microphone functionality would still work correctly.
- **Multimedia**
	- Lenovo L13 Gen5 and L14 Gen5  Intel video codec errors (graphic glitches during accelerated video playback)
- **Hardware**
	- Wake on LAN is not functional on Lenovo K14 Gen1
	- Built-in fingerprint sensor is not supported on HP mt440 G3 and mt645 G7/G8.
	- If using 6 x 4K@60Hz monitors on HP t755/t740 with the additional graphic card, one or two of the monitors may stay black after coming back from DPMS off state.
	  This is caused by using the additional graphic card as primary, which only has 512MB VRAM (the VRAM is not sufficient in this configuration). Possible solution: Increasing the VRAM size of the iGPU to 2048MiB in BIOS (maybe 1024MiB may also work) and activate IGEL registry key `x.drivers.swap_card0_with_card1` so the iGPU will become the Primary GPU. Connector names will be changed with that!
	- Wake up from suspend via UMS does not work on HP mt645 G7 devices. Workaround: Disable system suspend and use shutdown instead.
	- Rotation of displays connected to the Lenovo ThinkPad USB-C Hybrid Dock may fail.
	- Display configuration of displays connected to HP G5 Docking Station may fail on HP t655. Furthermore displays connected to HP G5 Docking Station may not work anymore after system suspend and resume independent from the used hardware.
	- On Lenovo ThinkPad L13 Intel Gen5, the functions keys Ctrl+Fn+F9, Ctrl+Fn+F10 and Ctrl+Fn+F11 are not mapped.
	- On Lenovo ThinkPad models equipped with AMD graphics, when connected to a USB-C Universal Dock driving multiple 4K displays via DisplayPort, system boot or reboot may result in incomplete display initialization. In these cases, one or more external displays may remain black while others function normally. Disconnecting and reconnecting the dock restores full multi-display functionality.
	- When using an HP G5 Dock, disconnecting and reconnecting the dock may cause display configurations (such as display order, resolution, and orientation) to be lost. After reconnection, displays may revert to default settings, requiring manual reconfiguration. For some devices, this issue can be mitigated by setting the registry key `x.xserver0.quirks.dp_mst_hotplug` to “Never.”
- **Dual Boot BC/DR (IGEL OS)**
	- The IGEL Dual Boot menu sometimes does not accurately reflect the presence of a UD-Pocket:
	  - If the "fast boot" BIOS option is turned on for HP devices, the state won't be updated between reboots. Turning off "fast boot" provides accurate detection.
	  - The boot loader doesn't currently detect UD Pockets on Lenovo devices. Using the Lenovo boot menu (F12) allows booting from UD Pockets directly but the "fast boot" BIOS option also interfere with the detection of USB boot devices.
- **IGEL Desktop**
	- On-screen keyboard sporadically crashes when typing.
	- If two monitors are configured in a vertical layout (one above the other), and those monitors are configured with "auto-detect" resolution, saving leads to a wrong layout order.
	- There are some UI elements that are not yet translated in all available user interface languages.
	- In very rare cases, the Start menu or panel may not be visible after boot. A reboot will restore visibility in such cases.
- **Licensing**
	- Manual deployment of add-on licenses for IGEL Agent for Imprivata licenses (via UMS) is only possible after finished installation of IGEL Agent for Imprivata app on device.
	- Endpoints that have a Starter License but no Workspace Edition license will not receive device settings or app management from UMS if add-on licenses are installed.
	Workaround: Either remove the add-on licenses or assign a valid Workspace Edition (or Workspace Edition Demo) license.
- **Mobile Broadband**
	- F11 flight mode function key does not switch off mobile broadband on HP Elite mt645 G7. (Deactivate mobile broadband in Network / Mobile Broadband settings)
