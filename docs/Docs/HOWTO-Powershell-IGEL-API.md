# HOWTO Powershell IGEL API

IGEL Management Interface (IMI) enables you to connect UMS to systems management tools. It is a programming interface that can create and delete thin clients, move them between directories, reboot them and much more. Its implementation as a REST API makes IMI agnostic of hardware platforms, operating systems and programming languages, thus ensuring maximum interoperability.

PSIGEL is a powershell module that makes use of the REST API provided by the IGEL Management Interface (IMI).
