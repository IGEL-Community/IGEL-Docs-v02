## FAQ - Time Service

**Q:** Do I really have to have the correct time / date on all my computers?

**A:** YES! In SSL, clocks are used for certificate validation. The client needs to make sure that it talks to the right server; for that, the client will validate the server's certificate. Validation implies verifying a lot of things; two of them involve clocks:

  - The server's certificate (and all involved CA certificates) must include the present time in their validity time range. Each certificate as a notBefore and a notAfter fields; the current time must fall between these two dates.
  - The client is supposed to obtain the revocation status of each certificate, by obtaining (and validating) a CRL (Certificate Revocation List) from the appropriate issuers (the CA). A CRL is deemed acceptable if (in particular) it is "not too old": again, the CRL has a thisUpdate field that says when it was produced, and a nextUpdate field that more-or-less serves as expiration date for the CRL.

If the client's clock is off, then it will break either or both of these functionalities. For instance, the server's certificate will be considered as "long expired", or "Invalid server certificate: certificate is not yet valid", leading to rejection.

  - OS 12: `Setup > System > Time and Date > Use NTP time server`
  - OS 12: `NTP time server` pool.ntp.org
  - OS 12: Check that time NTP is enabled: `get system.time.ntp_enabled`
  - OS 12: Check NTP time server: `get system.time.ntp_timeserver`

**Q:** How to automate license renewal?

**A:** Use UMS UMS Automatic License Deployment. UMS checks registered devices every 24 hours for unlicensed devices and will issue a new license. In UMS `UMS Console > UMS Administration > Global Configuration > Licenses > Deployment` enable automatic license exchange and select `Licenses are exchanged [number] days before expiration`: Defines how many days before the expiration date a new license should be deployed. (Default: 7). [IGEL KB - License Deployment](https://kb.igel.com/en/universal-management-suite/12.04.120/deployment-deploying-licenses-through-the-igel-ums)

**Q:** How does hardware-bundled IGEL licenses work?

**A:** Hardware-bundled IGEL license will be purchased together with hardware manufactured by an IGEL Hardware Partner. This type of license, will be a IGEL PAS (Platform Access Subscription) which is deployed based on the serial number of the device it is sold with. The license can be deployed automatically through the Universal Management Suite (UMS) or manually through the IGEL Licensing Portal (ILP). The license can be separated from its hardware and can be deployed on a different device. [IGEL KB: Hardware-Bundled IGEL License Deployment](https://kb.igel.com/en/igel-subscription-and-more/current/hardware-bundled-igel-license-deployment)

**Q:** How to remove expired / unused licenses from UMS?

**A:** There is also a new Administrative Task available in UMS 12.06 that will remove expired / unused licenses from UMS.

**Q:** We have a customer, which is migrating to another provider. How can we migrate an entire Product Pack from one licensing portal to another?

**A:** Reach out to your IGEL Sales Rep or partner. There are legalities to this that need to be confirmed, and paperwork that needs to be submitted by both sides. Once everyone approves, usually the licenses can then be transferred. If you don't have a direct IGEL Sales contact, you can try submitting a license question request via the [IGEL Customer Portal](https://support.igel.com/). There is a button for this on the landing page.

## FAQ - ICG 12

**Q:** Is ICG 12 needed with UMS 12 for OS 12 devices not on the same network as the UMS 12?

**NOTE:** Reverse proxy with SSL offloading is possible as of UMS 12.02. See [Configure the UMS to Integrate Reverse Proxy with SSL Offloading](https://kb.igel.com/en/universal-management-suite/12.04.120/configure-the-ums-to-integrate-reverse-proxy-with-)

**A:** That depends on if your security team will allow UMS 12 on port 8443 to be opened to the Internet or connected to internet via reverse proxy
(such as F5 / NetScaler / Azure Application Gateway). If the above options cannot be met, an ICG 12 will be needed to support OS 12 devices. Similar sizing guidelines for ICG 12 (setting connection limit to 2K / 2.5K devices). See [IGEL KB: ICG 12](https://kb.igel.com/en/igel-cloud-gateway/12.04/) and [IGEL KB - IGEL Cloud Gateway vs. Reverse Proxy for the Communication between UMS 12 and IGEL OS Devices](https://kb.igel.com/en/universal-management-suite/12.04.120/igel-cloud-gateway-vs-reverse-proxy-for-the-commun)

- Starting with UMS 12.04, IGEL is now compatible with all industry standard reverse proxies.

- [IGEL KB: Configure the UMS to Integrate Reverse Proxy with SSL Offloading](https://kb.igel.com/en/universal-management-suite/12.04.120/configure-the-ums-to-integrate-reverse-proxy-with-)

**Q:** To secure reverse proxy, what are the paths that need to be enabled?

**A:** UMS endpoint paths for Reverse Proxy integration. The used/required paths for OS12 and UMS Web App:

- The paths required for OS 12 device connections to the UMS (via a Reverse Proxy) are:

```bash linenums="1"
The root path is:

/device-connector/device/*

in more details it would be:

/device-connector/device/ws-connect
/device-connector/device/portforwarding
/device-connector/device/.well-known/est/*

and also the appproxy path is required:

/ums-appproxy/*

The device communication is always TLSv1.3.

In case the UMS Web App should be used via a Reverse Proxy the following paths are required:

/wums-app/*
/webapp/*

Here TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 is used.
```

**Q:** How is the Universal Management Suite (UMS) and IGEL Cloud Gateway (ICG) integrated with Network components like Firewalls and Reverse Proxies?

**A:** [IGEL KB: IGEL Universal Management Suite Network Configuration](https://kb.igel.com/en/universal-management-suite/12.04.120/igel-universal-management-suite-network-configurat)

## FAQ - Single Sign On (SSO)

**Q:** Does IGEL SSO with OS 12 work with OpenID Connect?

**A:** Yes! IGEL SSO with OS 12 will work with identity provider (IdP) that supports [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/). [IGEL KB: Apps and Utilities for IGEL OS 12 That Support SSO with OpenID Connect (Generic)](https://kb.igel.com/en/igel-os-base-system/12.4/how-to-configure-single-sign-on-sso-on-igel-os-12)

**Q:** How IGEL SSO Work?

**A:** With IGEL single sign-on, users sign in once with a single account and get access to multiple applications. The application can be a local client (e.g., AVD), web, or single page application (on browser), regardless of platform or domain name.  When the user initially signs into the IGEL login screen, Identity Providers:

- Microsoft Entra ID (aka Azure AD)
- OpenID Connect (Generic)
- Okta
- Ping Identity / PingOne
- VMware Workspace ONE Accesss 

 persists a cookie-based session. Upon subsequent authentication requests, the Identity Provider reads and validates the cookie-based session and issues an access token, without prompting the user to sign in again. If the cookie-based session expires or becomes invalid, the user is prompted to sign-in again.  A web, local app, or single page application can be protected by an OAuth2 access token, ID token, or [SAML](https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml) token. When a user tries to access a protected resource on the app, the app checks whether there is an active session on the application side. If there is no app session or the session has expired, the app will take the user to the IdP's sign-in page.

**Q:** How to enable SSO via a cloud-based identity provider (IdP) to enable access to the local OS 12 device and applications?

**A:** With IGEL OS 12, you can use Single Sign-On (SSO) via a cloud-based identity provider (IdP) to access the local device and apps. [IGEL KB: Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://kb.igel.com/en/igel-os-base-system/12.4/how-to-configure-single-sign-on-sso-on-igel-os-12)

**Q:** What is the process workflow for how SSO works between web apps, Microsoft Entra ID (aka Azure AD) / Okta and IGEL OS 12?

**A:** Here is the workflow.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant A as Unauthenticated OS 12 Device
  participant B as Authenticated OS 12 Device
  participant C as Identity Provided (Microsoft Entra ID / Okta)
  participant D as Web Application / VDI
  A->>C: 1 - User inputs credentials and MFA details if required
  C->>B: 2 - Authenticated user receives a session cookie and gains access to IGEL Desktop
  B->>D: 3 - User opens SSO configured web app / VDI
  D->>B: 4 - Session cookie is validated and grants secure access to the requested web app / VDI resource
  B->>A: 5 - Session cookie is cleared on logout / reboot / shutdown
```

## FAQ - Networking

**Q:** How to setup Cisco ISE (IEEE 802.1x)

**A:** The setup:
 
  - The devices must meet (DHCP IGEL tag) + (Port 30001) requirements
   - Then allowed to access the UMS, SCEP, Imprivata servers for initial Imaging
   - Then, 802.1x LAN IGEL policy is applied and they Authenticate via TLS properly to LAN.
   - Then the network is open for the device.
 
Have Cisco ISE engineer use (DHCP IGEL tag) + (ITC* hostname) to fingerprint the device and apply an "IGEL Device for Imaging" ISE Policy. This allows access to SCEP, UMS, Imprivata, etc until 802.1x kicked in. Use the same certificates that is already setup for Cisco ISE Wireless. If 802.1x Auth fails, then it attempts a normal LAN connection. So it's safe to test.  You'll need a Cisco ISE engineer to see in their logs that it was successful.
