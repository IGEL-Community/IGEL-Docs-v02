## Microsoft AVD and Windows 365 Cloud PC

Windows 365 Cloud PC and Azure Virtual Desktop are both cloud-based solutions that deliver Windows desktops to users, but they have different features, pricing, and management models. Windows 365 Cloud PC is a fully managed SaaS solution that offers easy and predictable per-user pricing and a turn-key deployment, but does not support virtual desktop pools or automatic scalability. Azure Virtual Desktop is a cloud VDI that allows users to fully customize their infrastructure and manage the resources that work within the virtualized infrastructure, but requires more IT skills and has a more complex pricing method based on resource consumption.

## Citrix  - Cloud Service Trials

Trials for individual Citrix Cloud services are delivered through the Citrix Cloud management console. The functionality in a service trial is the same as the purchased service, so they’re suitable for a proof-of-concept (POC) or pilot deployment.

When you’re ready to buy Citrix Cloud services, your trial is converted to a production service. There’s no need to reconfigure anything or create a separate production account.
