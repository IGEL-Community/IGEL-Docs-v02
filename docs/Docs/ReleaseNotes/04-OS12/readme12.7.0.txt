- Updated boot chain with
	- New SHIM 15.8, signed by Microsoft
	- New GRUB 2.12
- Added: The new secure boot chain also includes Kernel lockdown patches, meaning that all modules must now be signed.
- Changed update parameter to enhance control over management of assigned apps.. Registry keys were kept to to maintain backward compatibility.
	|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Type       |  Value      |

	- The new secure boot chain also includes Kernel lockdown patches, meaning that all modules must now be signed.
	- In the future, the optional kernel modules will be integrated into the base kernel, replacing the optional-kernel-modules app.
- Removed OMX support from system (used for video encoding/decoding), as it is not longer supported with newer Mesa versions.
- Added basic support of Japanese keyboard input methods (mozc). Enable using following parameters:
	| IGEL Setup | Parameter | Registry | Value |
	| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
	| User Interface>Input>Keyboard>Input Methods | `Keyboard input methods (experimental)` | userinterface.keyboard.ibus.enable | **disabled**/enabled |
	| User Interface>Input>Keyboard>Input Methods>Methods | `Japanese - Mozc` | userinterface.keyboard.ibus.general.preload-engine-mozc-jp | **disabled**/enabled |
- Updated End User License Agreement (EULA) to the February 2025 version.
- Added "No Tofu CJK" fonts supporting e.g. Japanese.
- **Network**
	- Added possibility for assigning an Ethernet device as a slave to a bridge device
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `Bridge`  |  `network.interfaces.ethernet.device%.bridge`  |  [] [own]  |    |
	  - Currently, only the "own" mode is supported. This creates a bridge with the associated Ethernet device (instance of network.interfaces.ethernet.device%) as its sole slave. Additional slave devices can be added separately.
- **WiFi**
	- Added support for WiFi module of ATrust mt183W.
	- Added newer Realtek WiFi drivers, along with corresponding configuration.
	- Added Realtek WiFi drivers for 8852bu and 8852cu devices.
	- Added new registry keys to configure used driver:
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `Use 8821cu driver instead of rtw_8821cu for WLAN.`  |  `network.drivers.realtek.use_8821cu`  |  [Auto][Yes][No]  |  *Auto*  |
		|  `Use 8812au driver instead of rtw_8812au for WLAN.`  |  `network.drivers.realtek.use_8812au`  |  [Auto][Yes][No]  |  *Auto*  |
		|  `Use 8814au driver instead of rtw_8814au for WLAN.`  |  `network.drivers.realtek.use_8814au`  |  [Auto][Yes][No]  |  *Auto*  |
		|  `Use 8821au driver instead of rtw_8821au for WLAN.`  |  `network.drivers.realtek.use_8821au`  |  [Auto][Yes][No]  |  *Auto*  |
		|  `Use 8821ce driver instead of rtw_8821ce for WLAN.`  |  `network.drivers.realtek.use_8821ce`  |  [Auto][Yes][No]  |  *Auto*  |
	- Added registry key for controlling kernel parameters arp_evict_nocarrier and ndisc_evict_nocarrier for WiFi with WPA Supplicant. The default "1" leaves the traditional behaviour unchanged, i.e. the respective tables are evicted particularly during roaming. "0" results in quicker resumption of sending packets after roaming, but it also leads to some packet loss.
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `ARP/NDP evict on no-carrier`  |  `network.interfaces.wirelesslan.device0.arp_ndisc_evict_nocarrier`  |  [0][1]  |  *1*  |
	- Added registry keys for restricting frequencies used by WPA Supplicant (see the WPA Supplicant documentation regarding the network-specific settings freq_list and scan_freq). In IGEL OS, the settings affect all configured WiFiÂ´s - these may be useful to improve roaming behavior.
		| Parameter | Registry | Type | Value |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		| `List of frequencies to scan` | `network.interfaces.wirelesslan.device0.scan_freq` | string | empty *Default* |
		| `List of allowed frequencies` | `network.interfaces.wirelesslan.device0.freq_list` | string | empty *Default* |
	- The default of the following registry keys has been changed from "Default" to "Automatic". It is still the case that "Automatic" means no restriction on the ciphers used and "Default" means CCMP for WPA2 and TKIP for (old industry-standard) WPA. With this change connecting to old access points is more likely to succeed.
	- If the previous "Default" shall be enforced, it must be done in the setup individually for the affected WiFi configurations. This applies not only to newly created configurations but also to those created earlier.
	- The OS12 setup assistant has always explicitly configured "Automatic".
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `Data encryption (broadcast/multicast)`  |  `network.interfaces.wirelesslan.device0.alt_ssid%.wpa.group_cipher`  |  [Default][TKIP][AES (CCMP)][AES (CCMP) + TKIP][Automatic]  |  *Automatic*  |
		|  `Data encryption`  |  `network.interfaces.wirelesslan.device0.alt_ssid%.wpa.pairwise_cipher`  |  [Default][TKIP][AES (CCMP)][AES (CCMP) + TKIP][Automatic]  |  *Automatic*  |

	- Added hardware support for Pepperl+Fuchs BTC22
	- Added hardware support for the Pepperl & Fuchs dual-mode Bluetooth and WiFi module LM812.
	- Added a new hotkey for Lenovo laptops: Ctrlâ¯+â¯Fnâ¯+â¯ââ¯(F12) now launches the default web browser, or, if one is already open, moves the cursor to the address bar for instant URL entry.
	- Added hardware support for Lenovo M70q Gen 6.
	- Added support for new IGEL Business Continuity USB Boot devices - Type A (BC2-LX) and Type C (BC3-LX).
	  - Due to incompatibility a downgrade to IGEL OS base system versions before 12.6.1 PR 1 is not possible.
- **Remote Management**
	- Added support for IGEL Asset Inventory Tracking (AIT). Requires UMS 12.08.100 or later.
		| IGEL Setup | Parameter | Registry | Type | Value |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		| System > Remote Management > Options | `Enable IGEL Asset Inventory Tracking (AIT)` | `system.remotemanager.ait.enable`  | bool | *enabled* (default) / disabled |
		| System > Remote Management > Options | `AIT events delay (secs)` | `system.remotemanager.ait.delay` | integer | 6 |
	- Added support for backup and restore VM command.
	- Added reporting of host's RAM and CPUs used in a virtual machine which is managed by IMH.

		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  System > Remote Management > Options  |  `Use "igelrmserver" as fallback`  |  `system.remotemanager.igelrmserver.as_fallback`  |  bool  |  enabled / *disabled* (default)  |
	- Added option to control whether to wait for (applying) remote settings before starting sessions.
		| IGEL Setup | Parameter | Registry | Type | Value |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		| System > Remote Management > Options | `Delay session start at boot time in order to apply new UMS settings` | `userinterface.sessions.wait-for-ums-config` | bool | enabled / *disabled* (default) |
		| System > Remote Management > Options | `Timeout` | `userinterface.sessions.wait-for-ums-config-timeout` | integer | 10 |

## Known Issues
- The downgrade to base system 12.00.900 or 12.00.910 is not supported.
- In very rare cases all apps are lost after an update. Should this be the case, an error message is shown "Opening system App Journal failed." - if the device is manged, the apps will be reinstalled after a reboot.
- Increased writeable cache partition size (by default). First boot with 12.4.x and newer may take more time (once) when updating from a 12.2.x or older base system app.
- Automatic proxy configuration: PAC file URL does not support https scheme.
- When TPM PCR+PIN device encryption is enabled, an additional PIN entry is required the first time a new base system release is booted.
- **App Management**
	- The "Download only" mode after app assignment via UMS, which requires a separate activation step, is not functional in this release. A fix is planned for the next base system (rolling) release.
- **Chromium**
	- Downgrading base system to earlier versions may result in reset of the Chromium profile partition.
- **Network**
	- In some cases, network is not working in combination of Lenovo K14 Gen1 (AMD) and Lenovo Universal Dock. There is a kernel bugreport open but no proper fix so far.
	- Device configured as Wake on LAN proxy can be shut down by the user or admin
	- Proxy passthrough authentication together with AD auto logon does work despite of shown error message during logon.
- **WiFi**
	- WiFi chipset BE200 does not work reliable in WiFi 7 networks.
- **HID**
	- Some touchpads are recognized as touchpad and mouse. This results in showing possible user settings for both variants.
- **Setup Assistant**
	- Timezone auto-detection is currently not functional (due to discontinued location service). The timezone must be set manually (as interims / alternative solution).
- **Audio**
	- Headset mic via jack is not working on LG 27CN650 and LG 34CN650.
	- Audio devices may not be available in audio tray app. Workaround: Enable Pulseaudio backend by registry key:
		|  Parameter  |  Registry   |  Range      |  Value      |
		| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
		|  `Audiobackend`  |  `multimedia.audiobackend`  |  [pipewire][pulseaudio]  |  *pipewire*  |
- **Multimedia**
	- Lenovo L13 Gen5 and L14 Gen5  Intel video codec errors (graphic glitches during accelerated video playback)
- **Hardware**
	- Wake on LAN is not functional on Lenovo K14 Gen1
	- Built-in fingerprint sensor is not supported on HP mt440 G3 and mt645 G7/G8.
	- If using 6 x 4K@60Hz monitors on HP t755/t740 with the additional graphic card, one or two of the monitors may stay black after coming back from DPMS off state.
	  This is caused by using the additional graphic card as primary, which only has 512MB VRAM (the VRAM is not sufficient in this configuration). Possible solution: Increasing the VRAM size of the iGPU to 2048MiB in BIOS (maybe 1024MiB may also work) and activate IGEL registry key `x.drivers.swap_card0_with_card1` so the iGPU will become the Primary GPU. Connector names will be changed with that!
	- Wake up from suspend via UMS does not work on HP mt645 G7 devices. Workaround: Disable system suspend and use shutdown instead.
	- Rotation of displays connected to the Lenovo ThinkPad USB-C Hybrid Dock may fail.
	- Display configuration of displays connected to HP G5 Docking Station may fail on HP t655. Furthermore displays connected to HP G5 Docking Station may not work anymore after system suspend and resume independent from the used hardware.
	- On Lenovo ThinkPad L13 Intel Gen5, the functions keys Ctrl+Fn+F9, Ctrl+Fn+F10 and Ctrl+Fn+F11 are not mapped.
- **App Bios Hp**
	- Due to new Secure Boot requirements (kernel lock-down enabled), the HP-BIOS-Tools app currently does not support the following HP Thin Clients:
		- HP t540 Thin Client
		- HP t640 Thin Client
		- HP Pro t550 Thin Client
		- HP Elite t655 Thin Client
		- HP t740 Thin Client
		- HP Elite t755 Thin Client
- **IGEL Desktop**
	- On-screen keyboard sporadically crashes when typing.
	- If two monitors are configured in a vertical layout (one above the other), and those monitors are configured with "auto-detect" resolution, saving leads to a wrong layout order.
	- There are some UI elements that are not yet translated in all available user interface languages.
	- In very rare cases, the Start menu or panel may not be visible after boot. A reboot will restore visibility in such cases.
- **Licensing**
	- Manual deployment of add-on licenses for IGEL Agent for Imprivata licenses (via UMS) is only possible after finished installation of IGEL Agent for Imprivata app on device.
- **Mobile Broadband**
	- F11 flight mode function key does not switch off mobile broadband on HP Elite mt645 G7. (Deactivate mobile broadband in Network / Mobile Broadband settings)
