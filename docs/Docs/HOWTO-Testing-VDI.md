## Microsoft AVD and Windows 365 Cloud PC

Windows 365 Cloud PC and Azure Virtual Desktop are both cloud-based solutions that deliver Windows desktops to users, but they have different features, pricing, and management models. Windows 365 Cloud PC is a fully managed SaaS solution that offers easy and predictable per-user pricing and a turn-key deployment, but does not support virtual desktop pools or automatic scalability. Azure Virtual Desktop is a cloud VDI that allows users to fully customize their infrastructure and manage the resources that work within the virtualized infrastructure, but requires more IT skills and has a more complex pricing method based on resource consumption.

## Omnissa (VMware) Horizon (TestDrive)

### 17 December - Omnissa TestDrive has migrated to the new demo domain

Omnissa TestDrive has migrated to the new demo domain, `asismon.com`. `asismon.com`, an anagram of Omnissa, has replaced `vmtestdrive.com`.

The demo domain represents the fake corporate entity that TestDrive RTU environments simulate. Technically, it's the domain for your TestDrive User Principle Name (UPN) and email address. Therefore, `username@vmtestdrive.com` is now `username@asismon.com`.

### What is TestDrive?

TestDrive is a self-service, cloud-hosted product demonstration platform available to Omnissa Employees, Partners and their customers which provides instant access to a fully featured, globally available, and integrated suite of Omnissa products.

### TestDrive Benefits

- Maintained by Omnissa thus it saves time and expenses of building your own demo environment.
- Fully configured demos where users can gain hands-on experience.
- Accelerates sales by inviting customers to experience Omnissa solutions in action, on-demand.

## Citrix  - Cloud Service Trials

Trials for individual Citrix Cloud services are delivered through the Citrix Cloud management console. The functionality in a service trial is the same as the purchased service, so they’re suitable for a proof-of-concept (POC) or pilot deployment.

When you’re ready to buy Citrix Cloud services, your trial is converted to a production service. There’s no need to reconfigure anything or create a separate production account.
