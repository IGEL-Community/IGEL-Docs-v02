## Steps a channel partner must take to work with IGEL support for a customer support case

- Make sure the channel partner is registered on the support portal

- Have the customer open a case and provide a description

- Post a comment to the case requesting that the channel partner be added to the watch list, including the following:

    - Channel Partner Name
    - Channel Partner Contact Name
    - Channel Partner Contact Email

- IGEL Support will pick that up, and add the requested person to the watch list, and they will receive updates, and be able to respond to the case via email
