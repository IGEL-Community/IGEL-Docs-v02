## 5 October 2023 - Microsoft Teams VDI 2.0

Microsoft recently released Microsoft Teams VDI 2.0 in public preview, a complete rewrite of Microsoft Teams. It offers a more streamlined interface, that requires fewer resources while used. 

Regarding IGEL and Azure Virtual Desktop / Windows 365 - Microsoft Teams VDI 2.0 still uses the WebRTC redirection service, so it is compatible with the current implementation of Microsoft Teams Offloading that IGEL already has in AVD/Windows365.

Additional details can be found here: [New Microsoft Teams for Virtualized Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/new-teams-vdi-requirements-deploy)

**NOTE:** For Citrix and VMware, the support requirements are mentioned in the above Microsoft link.

## Communication one-to-one vs. three (3) or more:

- If there are two (2) participants, communication is established as peer connection between the two IGEL devices.
- If there are three (3) or more, the peer is broken and all is orchestrated through the teams servers in the cloud. So, when 3 or more, IGEL OS sends the videos stream to a server in azure, that combine all video streams and send to all participants.

-----

## How to Check communication to the Microsoft API URLs and IPs?

If Microsoft Teams is not running in optimized mode, then check that the IGEL endpoint can communicate with the Microsoft API URLs and IPs?

- [Microsoft Teams - URLs and IP address ranges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-teams)

Run the following script in a local terminal window on IGEL endpoint:

```bash linenums="1"
#!/bin/bash

nc -u -v -z 13.107.64.21 3478-3481
nc -u -v -z 52.112.0.31 3478-3481
nc -u -v -z 52.120.0.41 3478-3481
nc -v -z teams.microsoft.com 80
nc -v -z teams.microsoft.com 443
nc -v -z compass-ssl.microsoft.com 443
nc -v -z mlccdnprod.azureedge.net 443
nc -v -z aka.ms 443
```

**Note:** For OS 12, install app [Debug Tools](https://app.igel.com/debugtools) to get `nc` command
