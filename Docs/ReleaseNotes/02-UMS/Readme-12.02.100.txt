Known Issues:
=============================================================================

[Unified Protocol]
- If the command logging for OS12 devices is activated the UMS Webapp needs to be installed on each UMS server.
- In an HA environment with installed UMS Load Balancer the scan and register command for OS 12 Thin Clients might not be successful. This problem occurs with OS 12 versions previous to 12.2.100.

=============================================================================
New features:
=============================================================================

[UMS common]
- Added: Direct assignment of OS12 profiles to OS11 devices is not allowed (and vice versa).

- Added: MS SQL Server option 'trustServerCertificate' (default is false, on upgrade set to true).
- Changed: 'Allow SSL connection only' setting (IGEL UMS Administrator -> Settings) is now checked by default.
- Updated: Azul Zulu JRE from version 8u352 to 17.0.7.

[Unified Protocol]
- Added: Log messages for commands sent by a device are now displayed in the UMS Web App logging section.
- Added: Proxies for management of OS 12 devices via ICG are now supported.

[Server, common]
- Changed: For each service only the registered license with the latest expiration date is transferred to a device.

[Administrator application]
- Added: Admin CLI commands to show, set and delete UMS cluster FQDN.

[Universal Customization Builder (UCB)]
- Removed: "Universal Customization Builder" feature from UMS.

[Installer (windows)]

[Device Service]
- Added: Export and import of OS12 profiles.
- Added: Export and import of OS12 app metadata.

=============================================================================
Resolved issues:
=============================================================================

[Console, common]
- Changed: The following characters are no longer allowed, when a new administrator account is created: "/ \ [ ] : ; | = , + * ? < >

[Views]
- Fixed: In the csv export of 'Send view result as mail...' (View context menu -> Send view result as mail...) entries with special characters were not correctly formatted.
- Fixed: View export via mail (view context menu -> Send view result as mail...) was missing all monitor information.

[High Availability Feature]
- Updated: HA Health check handles Distributed UMS correctly.

[Device Service]
- Fixed: Session order in the device configuration dialog was different in UMS Web App and Device.

[Installer (linux)]
- Fixed: For a 'client only' installation on Linux, the shortcut icons are now placed in the correct folder so that they can be displayed correctly.


=============================================================================
# UMS WebApp #
=============================================================================

=============================================================================
Known Issues:
=============================================================================

- The Search in the UMS WebApp will not work if UD Pockets are used in the UMS.

=============================================================================
New features:
=============================================================================
	   
[Apps]
- Added: Export of all/some/one version of an app (Metadata): App versions can be exported as '*.iam'. 
         This file contains all necessary data to be imported into another UMS. 
		 The artefacts needed for the device are not included and need to be retrieved by the device via the App Portal.
		 (The UMS does not handle these artifacts unless the 'use UMS as Update Proxy'-mode is activated.
		 If this update-proxy-mode is enabled please use the *.ipkg-data and workflow instead.)
- Added: Import of Apps (Metadata) via '*.iam'-packages as well as via *.ipkg-packages.

- Added: Import of OS12 Profiles: It is now possible to import OS12 profiles as '*.ipm'-packages. 
         The user can decide to import the profile in the selected folder or recreate the original folder structure.
		 Profiles can be imported as priority profiles and vice versa. If the folder structure needs to be recreated the path will begin with the new selected object root. (profile/priority profile)
- Added: Added a new tab to the profiles where the user can see which apps are configured within a profile (including the version of the used app).
- Added: Added functionality to open the configuration dialog by double-clicking on a profile (or priority profile).
- Added: Template Key functionality is now provided for Profile Configuration.

- Added: Export OS12 device settings as profile. It is now possible to export an OS12 device "as a Profile". All activated settings will be saved as a Profile. (*.ipm)
- Added: Added functionality to open the device-settings by double-clicking on the device.

[Search]
- Added: A completely new search functionality was added:
         Searches can be saved, edited, and reused.
         Complex searches can be used utilizing a SQL-like query language. (Activatable under "Advanced search")
         Simple searches will be translated into the query language to give the user insight into the structure. (If Advanced search is activated)
		 Please note: Time-based searches are currently not available on installation using a Derby-database. 
- Added: First implementation of autocompletion for the query language.

[Settings]

=============================================================================

[COMMON]

[Apps]
- Fixed: For communication with the App Portal (e.g., downloading Apps) the Proxy configuration is now taken into account.
- Fixed: Changing the Default Version of Apps will now trigger the update on the device.
- Fixed: A bug was present that caused database issues if the categories delivered by the app portal only differed in terms of case-sensitivity. 
- Fixed: Apps will now use the image from the latest version in database.
- Fixed: The automatic update of the standard version was not done after the automatic app import (if configured).
- Fixed: App version usages are now calculated correctly.
