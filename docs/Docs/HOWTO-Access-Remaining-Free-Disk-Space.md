- Configure the IGEL Setup (or UMS Profile), to enable Storage Hotplug at **Devices->Storage Devices->Storage Hotplug** and **User browse directory**
- Plug in USB device created on PC
- Make USB device bootable (open a terminal window as root)

```bash linenums="1"
cd /media/USB_Device_Name/utils/linux
bash makeboot.sh /dev/device_mount_point (lsblk can be used to determine device_mount_point)
```

- Reboot PC from USB created GParted
- Select the `VGA display option` and then select the defaults for the remaining items
- Create and add/save a new partition from free space remaining on PC
- Format the new partition as btrfs
- Reboot into IGEL OS and remove USB device
