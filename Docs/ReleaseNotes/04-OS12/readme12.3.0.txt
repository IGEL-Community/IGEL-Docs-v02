	- Added hardware support for LG AiO 27CQ650.
	- Removed support for UD7-LX 10 and UD7-LX 11 (devices do not meet minimal hardware requirements for OS12).
- **Remote Management**
	- Added support for custom device attributes.
	- Added device specific command support for OS12 Apps and OS12 Base System.
	- Fixed sporadically failures while retrieving authentication token within of a 'scan-and-register' or automatic registering process.
	- Switched to the IGEL's implementation of the EST, used for onboarding of devices running IGEL OS12.
	- Switched to RSA 4096 key pair instead of EC-521 - this broadens the compatibility with various application firewalls or reverse proxy systems. The existing key pair is automatically changed from EC to RSA during boot after device is removed from the UMS.
	- Fixed handling of CA chains issued by a public PKI - now the CA certificates of the involved public PKI are automatically added to trusted CA bundle during onboarding process.
	- Fixed retrieving of bootstrapping 'zero-trust' CA certificates - this is involved in ICG-style, automatic and 'scan-and-register' onboarding flows. The retrieving of CA certificates could fail if server side must be accessed over reverse proxy.
- **IGEL Desktop**
	- Added: If OS12 runs on UD Pocket, the Setup Assistant shows the unit ID (usb-serial-number) in system information.
	- Added option to configure time zone within calendar tray app. Feature can be disabled by parameter system.time.timezone_in_tray.
	- Changed default value of palmdetection from false to true.
	- The LAN system tray displays if connection is secured via MACsec.

	- Wake on LAN is not functional on Dell OptiPlex 3000 and Lenovo K14 Gen1
	- Built-in fingerprint sensor is not supported on HP mt440 and mt645.
	- If using 6 x 4K@60Hz monitors on a t755/t740 with the additional graphic card, one or two of the monitors may stay black after coming back from DPMS off state.
	- This is caused by using the additional graphic card as primary, which only has 512MB VRAM (the VRAM is not sufficient in this configuration)
	- The solution:
	-* Open BIOS and increase the VRAM size of the iGPU to 2048MiB (maybe 1024MiB may also work)
	-* Activation of IGEL registry key *x.drivers.swap_card0_with_card1,* so the iGPU will become the Primary GPU. Connector names will be changed with that!!
	- Wake up from suspend via UMS does not work on HP mt645 devices. Workaround: Disable system suspend and use shutdown instead.
- **IGEL Desktop**
	- On-screen keyboard sporadically crashes when typing.
	- XFWM4 composite manager can break screen lock and enables sporadically access to open applications. It is recommended to not enable registry key windowmanager.wm0.variables.usecompositing. The composite manager is disabled by default.
	- Closing shutdown dialog requires a double ESC key press.
	- If two monitors are configured in a vertical layout (one above the other), and those monitors are configured with "auto-detect" resolution, saving leads to a wrong layout order.
	- Some touchpads are recognized as touchpad and mouse. This results in showing possible user settings for both variants.
- **Licensing**
	- Manual deployment of add-on licenses for IGEL Agent for Imprivata licenses (via UMS) is only possible after finished installation of IGEL Agent for Imprivata app on device.
